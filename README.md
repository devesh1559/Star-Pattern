# Star-Pattern
## Aim- To Print the Star Pattern
## Theory- Star patterns are a series of * or any other character used to create some pattern or any geometrical shape such as - square, triangle(Pyramid), rhombus, heart etc. The program uses nested for loop. A for loop consists of three steps:- initialization, condition,
updation. 
## Algorithm- 
    step1: Start
    step2: Read number a
    step3: initialize i=0 , j=0, k=0
    step4: run 1.for loop from i=0 to  i=a
    step5: 	for i=0 to i=a
		for k=0 to k=a
			printf("\n");
		for j=0 to j<i
			printf("*");
		printf("\n");
    step6 : [end of loop step6]
    step9: go to next line
    step11: stop
 ## Conclusion-  
   We learn the usageof nested for loops
